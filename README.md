3D Models for Rat Wheel Setup

This repository contains 3D models for the rat wheel setup made in the Gilpin Lab

Models were created using Autocad Fusion, and prepared for printing using Bambu Lab Studio

Models were printed using a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon 3D Printer

Filament: PLA Basic (Black and White)

Magnetic Sensor used: SunFounder Switch Hall Sensor Module for Arduino and Raspberry Pi

I will provide the models as .f3d files as well as .3mf files
